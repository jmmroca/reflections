How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Yes, it helps to see the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because control version software help me to find out bugs and fix it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Nothing to say about this question.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is focused to dev by other side Google Docs is focused in text documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I dont know.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I dont know.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will learn Git to improve my skills in dev.
